We appreciate all kinds of contributions — whether it’s fixing bugs, improving performance, enhancing documentation, or introducing new features.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.  
   This allows you to freely make changes without affecting the main project.
   - Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner or [fork directly here](https://github.com/abhidahal/archane/fork).

   > [!NOTE]
   > **First-time contributors:**  
   > Start by submitting pull requests (PRs). Once you’ve consistently contributed high-quality PRs, you may be invited to join as a collaborator. Access to the main repository is granted based on demonstrated contribution quality and consistency.

2. **Clone your fork locally** so you can start making changes.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhidahal/archane.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for your work to keep changes organized.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes** and commit them using a clear, meaningful message.  
   Follow the [commit message guidelines](CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md).

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new magical UI component"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the main Archane repository.
